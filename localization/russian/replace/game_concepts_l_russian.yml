 game_concept_knight_desc:3 "A $game_concept_knight$ is a [vassal|E] or [courtier|E] that fights directly in your [army|E].\n\nDuring [battles|E], $game_concept_knights$ use their [prowess_skill|E] to fight more effectively. A high $game_concept_prowess$ means that they will be able to inflict more damage on the enemy, and are more likely to survive or even emerge from $game_concept_battle$ unscathed.\n\nA character cannot be a [commander|E] and a $game_concept_knight$ at the same time.\n\n#weak Knights can be known by different names depending on [culture] or [faith]. For example, $knight_plural_no_tooltip_english$, $knight_plural_no_tooltip_arabic_group$ or $knight_plural_no_tooltip_mongolic_group$.\n\nKnights represent both the character and their retinue of troops.#!"
